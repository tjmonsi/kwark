# Why "yet another"?

Because there is a lot of libraries already that does almost the same thing:
creating a better developer experience in creating re-usable web components.
This library hopes to make the footprint of the syntactic sugar really small
so that what the developer has to do is to create interactive components
with minimal footprint - meaning, the main logic of how the interaction
should be would be the one taking up more bytes than the library itself.

# I see similar code

There would be some similar code lifted from Polymer, LitElement and Element-Lite,
which are the base inspiration of the code. What I am hoping for this library
is to make it as small and as extensible as possible.
